COMP-8610: Midterm Project  
Sharjeel Mustafa

To run the code please ensure AHCD, UHAT, and EMNIST are downloaded in a data folder. Some utils are available in data.py but require manual execution to setup the data. Once datasets are prepared and conda environment is setup, you can run the code (by first altering the main.py) with the following command.

```py
python src.main
```
